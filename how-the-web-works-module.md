# Modele - How the Web Works

This module give a brief introduction to some of the big concepts of the internet.

[Code.org video series (20 minutes)](https://chnn-anne.gitbook.io/html-css/how-the-web-works/dns-tcp-ip-http-html):
* DNS
* TCP/IP
* HTTP
* HTML

There are questions in the course GitBook following each of the videos. They could be made into a quiz, or just used as a source of discussion.

[Anatomy of a Web Page](https://chnn-anne.gitbook.io/html-css/how-the-web-works/anatomy-of-a-web-page)
Covers a brief history of HTML and how it evolved to HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Give examples of each of these technologies, both in a simple set of demo files, as well as real web sites.

The [html-basic-elements](https://github.com/hoc-demos/html-basic-elements#readme) demo has the code for the examples in the topic material in the files no-markup.html and markup.html.

[How a Web Page Gets Loaded](https://chnn-anne.gitbook.io/html-css/how-the-web-works/how-a-web-page-gets-loaded)

Reviews some of the concepts in the Code.org videos on how a page is loaded and requests to the server are made for each of the individual files that make up a web page.

Walks through loading a web page, and watching the network activity in Chrome Developer Tools to see the request for the original document and how it has mapped the URL to a DNS address.

Also can see the secondary requests for the embedded stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files.

The [Chrome Developer Tools Intro Lab](https://github.com/hoc-labs/chrome-dev-tools-intro) goes along with this lecture, allowing students to walk through these same steps themselves with a different site.
