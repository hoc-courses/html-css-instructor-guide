# Module - Introduction 

**Pre-requisites**
This module assumes that the software has already been installed. [Software Installation](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/software-installation.md)


## Overview
There are several applications/tools that students will need to use reguarly. The purpose of this module is to familiarize students with those tools and perform any configuration needed.


### Tools

The following are the tools that need to be covered. The sequence is important.
* brief Intro/Demo to Git/GitHub
* brief Intro/Demo to Terminal/CLI
* create class folder
* brief Intro to GitHub Classroom
* bash Shell Lab (in class)
* VS Code Intro


### Git/GitHub Introduction

Students need a general introduction to version control systems and why they are needed. 

* This resource briefly introduces Git/GitHub and what version control is. [Git/GitHub Intro](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-github-intro.md). It contains a link to the following video.
* This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbZf3lPMOYY&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYXbAL_Hps1Y--THRmaTFipj&index=9) is a good intro to why we need a version control system and what it does.

### Terminal/CLI - Bash Shell
Students are expected to use the CLI instead of the File Explorer to navigate around folder/files and to use the CLI to execute commands. 
* this [resource](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/terminal-cli-intro.md) is a general overview of the CLI and why it is useful and describes the most common commands.
* instructor should give a demo of common commands, such as creating folders/files, navigating folders, and commands such as ls, pwd, touch, mv, rmdir rm -r.
  
### Create Course Folder
Students should create a folder where they will store all course related material. 

Create a folder named **foldername**, where will you will put the project files for the course. You can decide for yourself where you want this course folder to reside.


Do not create the folder through the Desktop.  Use the Git Bash shell to execute these commands.

* from the Windows Start menu, start Git Bash.
* cd to the parent folder
* mkdir **foldername**, to create the folder.


## Using GitHub Classroom

Students need to learn how GitHub Classroom manages assignments and how specifically they will use GitHub Classroom in their daily work to get and turn in assignments.
* this [resource](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/github-classroom-intro.md) is a general overview of how GitHub Classroom works as well as a walkthrough for a first assignment. 

At this point, students should be ready to do the [Bash Shell Lab](https://github.com/hoc-labs/git-bash-shell#readme) during class to practice both CLI general commands and git ACP commands.




## Git/GitHub
* [Introduction](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-github-intro.md)
* [GitHub Classroom/Assignments](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/github-classroom-intro.md)
* [Git Commands](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-commands.md)

## Bash Shell Lab
Do this [lab](https://github.com/hoc-labs/git-bash-shell#readme) in class, since it is introducing a lot of new material. 


Walkthrough the following:
* instructor handing out an assignment link
* using the link to get lab repo
* cloning lab repo to local computer
* starting Git Bash Shell from Start Menu
* working on lab exercise
* git ACP commands, plus git status
* final ACP to turn in assignment

**Resources:**
* [Git Cloning](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-cloning-existing-repo.md)
* [Git Commands](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-commands.md)



## VS Code

Do the [VS Code Intro Lab](https://github.com/hoc-labs/vs-code-intro) in class to make sure students become familiar with basic operations they will do frequently.
