### Container Elements
Introduces the need for more HTML elements/CSS properties to control layout of the web page content and why semantic elements are an improvement over `<div>`.
* **generic container elements**
  * `<div>`
  * `<span>`
* **semantic elements**
  * `<header>`
  * `<nav>`
  * `<footer>`
  * `<main>`
  * `<section>`
  * `<aside>`
  * `<article>`
  * `<figure>`

**Walkthrough a Visual of Layout Principals**

Show HTML page without styling and then with styling applied that positions the content in a typical layout. 

Show how the sections map to semantic elements.

Show how the flow is down by default, and positional styling (grid/flex) only affects the immediate children.  Further styling within the children is needed, such as to make the content within a child flow horizontally. Four Square lab combines a grid with the use of a background image and box shadow.


### Grid/Flex

Overview of the use-cases for grid vs flex
* grid is best for 2-dimensional layout
* flex is best for 1-dimensional layout

Compare Columns in Grid/Flex
* grid has distinct column boundaries across rows
* flex wraps and does not have distinct column boundaries across rows. columns flow to fill row.

# Labs
There are lots of labs available for this section for a couple of reasons:
* grid/flex are a little hard to grasp at first, so they need a lot of practice.
* we've reach a point in the class where most of the techniques have been taught and now they need practice pulling it all together. the front-end mentor labs do this really well.
