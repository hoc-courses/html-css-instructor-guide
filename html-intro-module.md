# Module - HTML Introduction

This module introduces HTML. It covers the basic structure of an HTML document and the syntax for elements/attributes.

It introduces the most common HTML elements, such as those for text-editing, images, hyper-links. 

**Note:** this module does not cover forms or tables. They are introduced in a later module when there is a use-case for incorporating them into labs.

### Basic HTML

The topics covered in the reading include:
* boilerplate HTML
* meta section
* text-formatting elements
* image element
* video element
* anchor element

The instructor can simply show in an editor examples of each of the different elements/attributes.

At the end of introducing the basics, the students should be ready to practice on their own.  There are several labs to choose from.

[HTML Basic Elements](https://github.com/hoc-labs/html-basic-elements#readme) - a screen capture of a web page the students are asked to reproduce. It contains most of the common HTML elements. 

[HTML Basic Elements - Favorites](https://github.com/hoc-labs/html-basic-elements-favorites#readme) - students are given a simple wireframe of a web page containing a title/abstract and two images with a title above each. This can be used as an introduction to the Artice Progression lab.

 [Article Progression - Part 1](https://github.com/hoc-labs/article-progression#readme) - students are given a wireframe to build an article page that describes a topic of interest. The page contains the following sections:
 * title, byline
 * video, narrative
 * table of contents (links to internal sections)
 * three detail sections including
   * image
   * byline
   * narrative
  
The students selects the images/video from unsplash.com and pexels.com and the narrative text from loremipsum.io to learn how to use place-holder content in prototypes.
